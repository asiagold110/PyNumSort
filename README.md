## Installation

1.  Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).

    - Spaces (e.g., `5 2 8 1`)
    - Commas (e.g., `5,2,8,1`)
    - Hyphens (e.g., `5-2-8-1`)
3.  Click the **"Sort"** button.
4.  The sorted numbers will appear in the result field, separated by hyphens.
5.  Use the **"Copy Result"** button to copy the sorted list to your clipboard.
6.  Click the **"Clear"** button to reset everything and start over.
